**Solution Topic** - Demand Forecasting for retailers

**Problem background** - The shortage or surplus of inventory is a common problem faced by almost all the dukaandars of India and this problem even aggravated during the time of covid. Both surplus and shortage of inventory leads to huge losses for the retailers. This issue can be resolved if they can predict the future demand for the products depending on the seasonality and the changing market. So, here comes the AI technology to help them in this.

**Data** - As I didn't have the access to real data form the dukaandars therefore I chose to go forward with a dataset from kaggle which can be found <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting'>here.</a>
